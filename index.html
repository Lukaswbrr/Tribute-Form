          <p>Tsukihime is a visual novel made in 2000 by Type-Moon.</p>
          <p>The main character is Tohno Shiki where suddenly, his eyes changes, where he is able to see lines of deaths everywhere.</p>
          <p>The story is presented via text in first person. The story also has multiple options and different routes which affects the endings.</p>
          <p>This is my first (and favorite) visual novel i ever readed.</p>
        </div>

          <h2>My honest <s>reaction</s></s> opinion</h2>
          <p>it's peak......</p>
          <img src="https://external-preview.redd.it/7jzHhoSpT-YgQc1CHQD9quzmpzF_JAF-3chC5CjkrT8.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=026d816e2617ad27a636f456d17f888de80f7dbc" width=150>
          <p>But, on a serious note, this is my first time reading a visual novel and honestly, this was a great experience.</p>
          <p>The first route that i took was Ciel's route (because my friend said to choose the option to pick her route) and after that, i was choosing only options that helps go to her route</p> 
          <p>Whenever i look back at Tsukihime and all the screenshots that i made, it makes me feel nostalgic, like i was playing this game around the year 2000s, despite playing it in 2023.</p>
          <div id="review-pros">
            <h3>Pros</h3>
            <h4>2000s nostalgia</h4>
            <p>At first, it was weird having a kind of bad art style that was made around the 2000s, however by time, i got used to it. Not only that but the art story CGs (special artworks, like a full character background art or something) got better with which each route. (First route being Arcueid and the last being Kohaku. The art was majorly better around Kohaku and Hisui's route.)</p>
            <h4>First time reading visual novel experience</h4>
            <p>Since this was my first time reading a visual novel, this visual novel made me like first person story telling type alot.</p>
            <p>Choosing options that i wasn't aware if it would lead to a end made me nervous since i never readed something like this before.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="review-pros">
            <h3>Cons</h3>
            <h4>No Yumizuka Route</h4>
            <p>When i was reading this peak fiction, i didn't thought much about Yumizuka. However, after seeing that Yumizuka was supposed to have a route, that kinda made me sad because the game wasn't complete to the fullest. In Tsukihime's Extras, it was shown content of Yumizuka's route.</p>
            <p>Even though the explicit content is abit bad because it makes less people read the visual novel, since Yumizuka's route was scrapped, the explicit content of Yumizuka also gets cut (and in the remake, there is no explicit content). It would've been cool to see how the route would be if it was released in this version.</p>
            <h4>Arihiko doesn't play a major role in the story</h4>
            <p>In most of the routes, Tohno Shiki has a female partner in battle. I kind of wished that, atleast in one route, Arihiko had a major role as being Tohno Shiki's partner in battle.</p>
            <p>I also wished Arihiko was playable in Melty Blood. He could had a fighting style similiar to Arihiko from Persona 4 Arena (literally)</p>

            <h4>Explicit Content</h4>
            <p>While this is a double edged-sword opinion, i don't really like much the explicit content in this visual novel. (I also don't understand why Fate Stay Night has it. Was it to improve sales or something? Like Tsukihime was popular when Fate Stay Night got released, right???)</p>
            <p>In some routes, it made sense having the explicit content, for example, Arcueid and Kohaku's route but not some of the routes though. (Akiha's route....)</p>

          <h2>How it changed me</h2>
          <p>This visual novel <s>made me want cut a chair into 17 pieces</s> inspired me to make my own visual novel framework in Godot, named DemoScripter (which is a reference to NScripter, the visual novel engine Tsukihime was made on), research about ONScripter and etc!</p>
          <h3>DemoScripter</h3>
          <img src="https://github.com/Lukaswbrr/Demo-Scripter/blob/main/docs/DemoScripter_logo.png?raw=true" width=300 alt="demoscripter logo">
          <p>When using Godot for the first time around 2023, i was developing a game called <a href="">3D Ball Game</a> while following a video tutorial. I released the game in 2024 on itch.io! (not that it took a year to finish, but it took around a year to be public)</p>
          <p>Originally, there was meant to be a easter egg which tells the story of the game, however the easter egg got scrapped since i didn't have a framework that makes the story style writing similiar to Tsukihime (first person telling) [i tried using Dialogic addon, but it didn't work in the style that i wanted, so i made <a href="https://github.com/Lukaswbrr/Demo-Scripter">DemoScripter</a>.]. The easter egg only occurs if the player dies 5 times everytime.</p>
          <p>In case i make the sequel of the game in Godot 4, i will add the easter egg and expand the story since i want to add a level select to the game.</p>
          <p>DemoScripter is a visual novel framework that started as a test around september 2023. Slowly, it got added new features and in March 2024, it got released publicly on <a href="https://github.com/Lukaswbrr/Demo-Scripter">github</a>.</p>
          <p>As the time of writting this (07/04/2025) [DAY/MONTH/YEAR] Demo Scripter has not received any updates at all. The reason is that i'm focusing on other projects and freecodecamp.</p>
          <p>There are still some features left for DemoScripter that i want to add in the future for it be used as a actual addon for Godot. (Also, it's not a addon yet as of time of writing this, 09/04/2025) </p>
          <p>Here's some images related to Demo Scripter.</p>

          <h3>Using ONScripter</h3>
          <p>Around march of 2025, i decided to mess around on Tsukihime's files and decided to use ONScripter tools to make some changes for fun. Big thanks to Galladite27 for helping me in how to use ONScripter and explaining about it!</p>
          <p>When i extracted the nscript.dat file, i even managed to find hidden things related to Tsukihime! (from english patch which has easter eggs)</p>
          <p>Later, i will add the images about me using ONScripter!</p>
          <h3>Nanaya Shiki</h3>
          <img src="https://wiki.gbl.gg/images/2/27/Nanaya0.png" width=300>
          <p>I knew about this character before in Melty Blood through memes, however, i never knew about this character's lore. Even now, when i do know about why he's called Nanaya Shiki, i still haven't finished Kagetsu Tohya (fan disc of tsukihime), so i don't understand why he's on Kagetsu Tohya. (peak disc of Tsukihime) This is my favorite character in Tsukihime!</p>
          <p>I also played Blazblue CentralFiction on wifi (because i don't have ethernet port on my laptop)</p>
          <img src="https://i.redd.it/5xoic5durzd81.png" width=500>
          <p>But, due to Nanaya's incredible knowledge (and this image), i can rest well knowing that playing on wifi is okay as long as you're close to the route. (Thanks, ななや)

          <p>Once i finish Kagetsu Tohya and Fate Stay Night, i'm thinking of reading Umineko. (need to buy the visual novel first)</p>
          <p>And now, the curtain closes.</p>
